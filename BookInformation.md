`Info`: [Brian Aldiss](http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Articles/aldiss.html), in his book *Billion Year Spree*, claims that Frankenstein is, "the first seminal work to which the Science Fiction label can be logically attached". Frankenstein is a well known character in modern pop culture, whether it's erroneously referring to Victor, his creator, or correctly as the monster that Victor creates in the novel. *Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus* is a novel that presents ethical problems told through both the perspectives of the creator and the creation, leaving the reader to determine who is the real monster in the story. The novel's most prominent themes include *the quest for knowledge*, *consequences of forbidden knowledge*, and *humanity*. These themes would later be explored thoroughly in the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, in particular [*At the Mountains of Madness*](http://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/mm.aspx) would be catalyst for the science-fiction and horror genre in the 20th century, and would find their place in another seminal work: [*The Island of Dr. Moreau*](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/159/159-h/159-h.htm) by H.G. Wells.
