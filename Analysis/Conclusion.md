## Conclusion
An interpretation of the data found in textual analysis of *Frankenstein*, *Journey to the Center of the Earth*, and *The Time Machine* doesn't provide any hard and fast relation between the three works. An interesting insight is that the Gunning-Fog index scores, or Readability scores, of all three books are very similar hovering at an average of a 8.06. For all three works vocabulary density seems moderately high, with no book less than 9%. As a point of reference the J.R.R Tolkien's *[The Hobbit](link)* has a vocabulary density of [6.88%](link), the highest of his the Middle Earth works. Among the three works analyzed, *The Time Machine* features the highest vocabulary density, likely due to its comparatively short length which it shares with *The Hobbit*
