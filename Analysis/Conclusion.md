## Conclusion
An interpretation of the data found in textual analysis of *Frankenstein*, *Journey to the Center of the Earth*, and *The Time Machine* doesn't provide any hard and fast relation between the three works. An interesting insight is that the [Gunning-Fog Index](http://gunning-fog-index.com/) scores, or Readability scores, of all three books are very similar hovering at an average score of a 8.06. At the outset of this project we predicted the Readability scores to be much closer to a value of 11 or 12 and it's surprising to see that the works seen here scored 25% lower than predicted, which indicates a reading level suited for a High School Freshman.


For all three works vocabulary density seems moderately high, with no book less than 9%. As a point of reference the J.R.R Tolkien's *[The Hobbit](https://archive.org/stream/TheHobbitByJ.R.RTolkien/The%20Hobbit%20by%20J.R.R%20Tolkien_djvu.txt)* has a vocabulary density of [6.88%](http://lotrproject.com/statistics/books/wordscount), the highest of his the Middle Earth works. Among the three works analyzed, *The Time Machine* features the highest vocabulary density, likely due to its comparatively short length which it shares with *The Hobbit*. 


While we discovered no strong quantitative link within the text of these three 19th century works of Science Fiction, some qualitative predictions hold true. The sentiment scores each book was given lined up well with the general tone of the book, reinforcing the quality of the analysis as well as our understanding of the books themselves.
